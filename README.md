#
#
#
#   Purpose:    
#               to create an utility to choose better passwords for users,
#               as people have a tendency to use easy to remember passwords
#               which are prone to common attacks, such as dictionary attack

#   Usage:      
#               Run python or python3 python-password-generator.py, depending
#               on the user's environment settings
#               Once executed, a random password is generated and stored
#               in a plain text file named output.txt in the same directory
